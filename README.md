A short tutorial on Artificial Neural Networks in Python using Keras.

Key highlights of this tutorial:
1.	Introduction to Neural Networks - covers classification problem set, neural network arrchitecture, components and activation functions
2.	Neural Network Implementation - covers anaconda/miniconda basics, keras libraries/dependencies installations, keras classification models - feed-forward and backpropagation algorithms, training and testing analysis.
3.	Network Parameter Settings - covers demonstration of network layers, number of neurons in a layer, optimizer, loss function, learning rate, dropout, batch size and epochs
4.	Discussion and Network implementation on pratical classification datasets.


Pre-requirements:
Install Python version 3.6+ and Miniconda (from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your machine, OR Access to Google Colab (from https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb)
